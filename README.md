# Redux quiz group project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

This is a quiz project that displays questions about food and then a summary of the guessed questions at the end. The quiz is timed and has a progressbar to show the user the progress. It is using Redux store to save question and answer information.

## The problem

This quiz is using React and Redux to get the store to show the questions and store the answers so that they can be displayed later in the summary page. We planned by talking about all the components we needed, how we wanted the flow to be and what features we wanted to add to the page to enrich it. It is using both CSS and styled components to style it and multiple smaller components that are mounted to make the page. The questions are in five different componets that uses a "questionsSwitcher" to mount and switch between them using if statemtents.
